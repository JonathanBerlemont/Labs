# Labs

The purpose of this project was learning to use the Laravel framework on a realistic scale with a website that has many features.
The design of the public side of the website was given to me so I could focus completely on Laravel and not waste time designing.

## Public Side
On this website, you could see various projects and services provided by the team. 
You could also see articles written by the online staff. These articles can be commented by public users.
You could send mails to the site owners and subscribe to a newsletter.

## Admin Side
On this side, which was the most interesting, you could administrate everything depending on whether you were a writer or an admin. 

Writers could view everything besides the mails and newsletter subscribers. They could only write new articles.
Admins could handle their staff's roles, see the mails sent to them through the website using an interface close to a real mail inbox and modify contact informations. They also could moderate the comments posted under the articles.
